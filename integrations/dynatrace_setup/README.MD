# Dynatrace Code

This code serves as an example of how we implemented payloads with Dynatrace and BIG-IP Next. You can use this code as a guide for setting up various components such as Dynatrace Workflows, Collectors, and monitoring.

**Note:** WAF Policy Logs are sent from F5 BIG-IP Next via WAF Policy to the Collector. This is how Dynatrace receives the logging information.

We have also included the BIG-IP Next WAF Policy file ("bigip_next_WAF_Rapid-Template.json") as an example of the WAF Policy used in this solution.
