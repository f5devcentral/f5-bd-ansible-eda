# ElasticSearch Watcher Code

This code serves as an example of how we implemented payloads with ElasticSearch. You can utilize and modify this Watcher Code to work for your environment, and see how the payloads are being sent back to EDA from Elastic.

**Note:** WAF Policy Logs are sent from F5 to Elastic, which is how it retrieves this information.
